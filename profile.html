      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Yuval. I worked in the Internet and software industry for most
        of my career, starting at the age of 18, working in different positions
        and fields. Somewhere in the middle there I had a few years where I did
        several odd jobs working in bars, night clubs and even air planes before
        coming back to software. Sitting in a fancy office is quite comfortable,
        but dancing around all night and getting paid for it had it's charm.
        Clouds are really cool too.
